let descriptions : [String] = ["In today's video I show you how to navigate between screens in your SwiftUI app using NavigationView and NavigationLink. I also the the basics of passing data between views as well as some simple customizations.",
"A Swift and IOS design course created for beginners. This course is 10 hours long! The part that is relevant to us is the first 2.5 (or so). THis goes beyond what we have learned in class, but includes the other materials we will continue to explore next semester.",
"In this video we will learn to build our very first app with SwiftUI for beginners. We will cover fundamental concepts such as view stacking, viewModels, state objects, and more. Our app will be called PhotoMania.","In this video we will build our veery first iOS/iPhone app from scratch in Xcode 12 and Swift 5. This tutorial is for absolute beginners who have never built an iOS app before. We will specifically build a Photo Generator app.", "This video is a compilation of the first 8 videos in my SwiftUI Fundamentals course as a free preview. In this set of videos we learn the basics of building your app with SwiftUI by creating the user interface for a standard weather app.", "Learn how to add your own custom fonts in your SwiftUI app! Custom fonts can add a ton of personality to your app but make sure you don’t go overboard with it and compromise legibility!", "In today's lesson we will be looking at how we can create our very own custom color picker from scratch. In many situations you will find this a preferable approach since the default color picker offers FAR too many options which clutter the UX. Although you definitely could implement a way of triggering that default color picker in case the user doesn't like all your colors.", "This swiftui tutorial shows you how to create an animated progress bar in xcode.", "This easy SwiftUI animation tutorial walks you through how to create simple, complex, and custom animations in SwiftUI. In the tutorial, I show animation examples with a glassmorphism / material background list cell, a shape with offset and a linear gradient, and a button.", "In today’s video we will learn to make a twitter like app splash/launch animation with the twitter bird from scratch. Launch animations add creativity to your app and help it come to life. We’ll work in the latest version of Xcode and SwiftUI."]
